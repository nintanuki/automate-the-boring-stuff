# Coin Flip Streaks

This is a short program that simulates flipping a coin 100 times and checks if there is a streak of 6 heads or tails in a row. It repeats this experiment 10,000 times and calculates the probability of getting a streak of 6 heads or tails in a row.

This is my solution the practice project "Coin Flip Streaks" at the end of chapter 4 in [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/) by Al Sweigart.

The result is an average of 80%, which I thought was high and that maybe I did something wrong, but after Googling other solutions that is apparently the expected output.
