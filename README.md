# Zombie Dice Bots

This is my solution to the final practice project from [Chapter 6](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter6/) of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. You can find the complete rules and the rest of the code at https://github.com/asweigart/zombiedice/.

I met these requirements:

* A bot that, after the first roll, randomly decides if it will continue or stop
* A bot that stops rolling after it has rolled two brains
* A bot that stops rolling after it has rolled two shotguns
* A bot that initially decides itâ€™ll roll the dice one to four times, but will stop early if it rolls two shotguns
* A bot that stops rolling after it has rolled more shotguns than brains

But I was having too much fun and decided to experiment and make more bots. I made at least 10 and plan to try more configurations in the future. Other than Alice and Bob they are all named after Walking Dead characters.

So far Carl and Negan tend to win the most, and therefore they have the best strategy. They roll until they get 2 shot guns (unless they have 0 brains they keep going) and if they have 1 shotgun they keep going unless they have at least 6 (Negan) or 7 (Carl) brains.

Sometimes Maggie has the most wins at at least 5 brais. At the moment Lizzie is the only bot that makes decisions based on the color of the dice.

To run this code you must install the zombiedice module by typing `pip install zombiedice` in the terminal.
